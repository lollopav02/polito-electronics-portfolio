# Lorenzo Pavone · Electronics Portfolio

Projects and lab work from my Electronic Engineering studies at **Politecnico di Torino**:
RF hardware design, digital ASIC synthesis, FPGA and microcontroller-based embedded systems.

> Every folder has its own README with goals, methods, results and how to reproduce them.

## Projects

## Notes

All projects and labs were carried out in student teams; teammates are credited in each README.
Files provided by the courses (templates, board libraries) are marked as such, and proprietary
technology libraries are not included.
